Rails Gurus:
Here is a view issue that I have been butting my head against. Perhaps the collective wisdom here can help more efficiently than my hit and trial approach so far - given my limited Rails exposure.

Models:

 - User - has many Recipes and Step_summaries
 - Recipe - has many steps, belongs to User
 - Step - has many Step_summaries, belongs to Recipe
 - Step_summary - belongs to User, belongs to Step

In the view Step and Step Summaries are edited in place using the best_in_place gem. Recipe owners can edit steps, any user can create/edit a step summary. The current_user can choose to see either the Original Steps or his own Summaries(or both, done via javascript). The issue is, that the current_user will typically only summarize some steps of any given recipe, not all.

Here is what I want to accomplish - 
In the Original Steps column, show the original steps.
In the User Summaries column:

 - Show the summary if it exists 
 - Show the original step if it does not
